[**Striking a balance between security and usability**](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/10/striking-a-balance-between-security-and-usability/)
- Security and usability are often in tension, but they’re not necessarily opposed
- All user data on one page on the web - a lot of risk (identity theft)

- Design for security but do it proportionately - don’t get paralysed
- "Misuse cases": when you’re writing user stories also think about the misuse cases; think about how somebody might play with what you’ve built, or abuse it.
